# Google Chrome Extensions
<p> Google Chrome extensions are programs that can be installed into Chrome in order to change the browser's functionality.  </p>
<h3> Here I have implemented few basic chrome extensions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hello World</li>
    <li>SpeakIt</li>
    <li>WikiGO</li>
  </ul>

<li>Click on to the Load unpacked option and select the folder where all the files are present </li>
<li>Now its all set to use it. ENJOY!!</li>
